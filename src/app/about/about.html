        Jade thrives in dynamic environments, whether it’s a high-fashion
        editorial or an urban street shoot. Naomi specializes in raw, candid
        moments—think tearful vows at weddings or unguarded laughter between

        And Priya brings an architectural eye to every shot, transforming
        ordinary scenes into striking visual narratives. Together, they’re
        C-Squad — a dream team that balances technical precision with heart.

        striking editorial, C-Squad blends technical expertise with an intuitive
        eye for emotion and composition. Their collaborative approach ensures
        each client’s vision is brought to life with authenticity and flair.
